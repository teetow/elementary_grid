### Why?

With [Nick](https://github.com/nick-thompson) having released the WebAudio part of [Elementary Audio](https://www.elementary.audio/) I started pondering a suitable hobby hack. I recalled [Tonegrid](http://www.tonegrid.com/) (now defunct due to the Flashpocalypse) and especially how addictive it is. After a couple of false starts, I finally managed to get it working. A fresh coat of paint, a couple of options I always wanted, and here it is.

### Known issues and questions

* If you absolutely spray the grid with notes, you'll get some clipping. Aural injury insurance not included.
* Yes, you can use MIDI input with Elementary Audio. It's that awesome.
* Yes, you can use it to make VST and AU plugins.
* Yes, I'll try to make one. Later =)
